# learning-react
A series to learn React!

## Part 1 - Introduction/Taster

This first session will be a super quick shallow dive into what **React** is and what you can do with it - by the end of it _everyone_ should have built _some_ UI (or it could go chaotically wrong, who knows!). It is very much a taster and hopefully catered to people at all levels.

**I would recommend people get into pairs to work through the problems which will come up, ideally where half the pair has some engineering experience to help the newcomers!**

Before we begin please make sure you (your pair) follow these steps...

1. Ensure you have **node** (>=v6) installed on your machine. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository somewhere on your machine (use the [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't want to setup **git**)
3. Ensure you have your [editor](https://www.sublimetext.com) setup and ready to start hacking on the `/part-1` directory.
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the `/part-1` directory.

Give someone a shout in #learning-react slack channel if you need some help setting up!

## Part 2 - React Patterns

This session will be diving more into the data flow of React and what patterns it enables. Hopefully by the end of this everyone will really understand the fundamentals of how a React app is constructed and realise there's not really any magic!

Before we begin please make sure you have followed these steps to save time...

1. Ensure you have Node >= v6 installed
2. `npm install -g create-react-app@1.4.0`
3. `create-react-app my-react-app` (wherever you want to create a new project)
4. Set up your IDE ready to go in that newly created project directory

Once ready [lets go](./part-2)!
